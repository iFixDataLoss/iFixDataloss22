# iFixDataloss
This repository contains the iFixDataloss tool, the evaluation detail and all data loss issues detected by iFixDataloss, which are available in three separate folders: tool and source code, evaluation, and DataSet.

Specifically, the comparisions between iFixDataloss and the other two data loss detection tools(LiveDroid and DLD) for each app's activities are in the Results.xlsx which is in the evaluation folder. The picture below shows partial results.
